I am interested in developing innovative synthetic methodologies to precisely control metal–metal and spin-spin interactions in molecular systems, thereby unlocking innovative reactivities and electronic properties. These advancements will drive significant progress in bioinorganic chemistry, catalysis, lanthanide chemistry, materials science, and quantum information science, addressing fundamental scientific challenges and global sustainability needs.
