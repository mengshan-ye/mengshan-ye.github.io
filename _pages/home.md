I am Mengshan Ye (叶梦珊). I am currently a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, working with <a href="http://alchemy.cchem.berkeley.edu/home/">Prof. Jeffrey R. Long</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Massachusetts Institute of Technology with <a href="https://suessgroup.mit.edu/">Prof. Daniel L. M. Suess</a> and B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Science and Technology of China with <a href="https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/xiongyujie//">Prof. Yujie Xiong</a>. I will be starting my independent career as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University in August 2025! Visit my <a href="https://www.msyegroup.com/">group site</a>!

I am dedicated to developing innovative <b>synthetic methodologies</b> to precisely control <b><span style="color: #478BA3;">metal–metal</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #F37B67;">spin-spin interactions</span></b> in <b>molecular systems</b>, thereby unlocking <b>innovative reactivities and electronic properties</b>. These advancements will drive significant progress in bioinorganic chemistry, catalysis, lanthanide chemistry, materials science, and quantum information science, addressing fundamental scientific challenges and global sustainability needs.

My research takes an interdisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from (bio)inorganic chemistry, physical inorganic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, physical chemistry, lanthanide chemistry, and materials science to foster meaningful discoveries. I bring expertise in (air-free)inorganic and organic synthesis, (paramagnetic)NMR, EPR, Mössbauer, BS-DFT Calculation, crystallography, magnetometry, and electrochemistry.
